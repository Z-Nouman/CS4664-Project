# CS 4664 Brain Tumor Classification Project
PyTorch implementation of CNNs and transfer learning to classify brain tumor images for the CS 4664 course at Virginia Tech. 

If you choose this option, your repo needs to have a well-written Readme file that explains, in plain English, what the repo is about and which notebooks in it show which experiments.

# Environment
All experiments were run on either glogin at Virginia Tech or through Google Colab. Many of the packages used in this project came preinstalled on these platforms, but some notable ones include: PyTorch and Torchvision; Numpy; Sklearn; Matplotlib; Pickle

# Introduction

Ishan, please add a description of this project, similar to the intros you did for the presentations in class

# Dataset

The datasets we used we obtained through Kaggle. These files should be in the same directory as our code and unzipped prior to running any experiments. 

Binary Classification Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preetviradiya/brian-tumor-dataset
Multiclass Classification Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset

# Tasks

For these tasks, we wanted to compare different state of the art convolutional neural network architectures and determine the factors most important to accurately classify a brain tumor provided an image. The different models we wanted to compare include:

- ResNet18
- GoogleNet
- VGG11 with batch normalization

The tasks we have explored are as follows:

1) Binary classification using the binary classification dataset
2) Multiclass classification using the multiclass classification dataset
3) K-nearest Neighbor classifier to act as a baseline using the binary classification dataset
4) Automated hyperparameter tuning using a hyperparameter tuning framework {learning rate, momentum, batch size}
5) Empirical experiments to compare how model performance changes with respect to some variable {amount of training data, modle architecture, model size}
6) Interpretability experiments with T-SNE and Grad-CAM
7) Bonus tasks such as grade classification of brain tumors, application of our models on other types of tumor datasets, or classifying additional brain diseases
